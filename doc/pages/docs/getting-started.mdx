# Overview  
Getting started with &zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/>

## What is React Awesome Loaders?  
&zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> is an NPM package `react-awesome-loaders` which lets you create high-quality, super-responsive and customizable loading animations to insert into your website.

## Why I created it?
As the owner of UI projects like [MasterPortfolio](https://github.com/ashutosh1919/masterPortfolio) and [React LiquidSwipe](https://github.com/ashutosh1919/react-liquidswipe), I understand the importance of animations on frontend, especially the loading animations.  

I get many questions from beginners in frontend about how to create awesome loading animations or is any loading animation library available. 

The concept of &zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> is born with an idea to provide code snippets of code to beginners so that they can implement extra-ordinary loading animations in their frontend work.  

Effectiveness of `styled-components` and power of **CSS in JS** has made it more compact as well as reusable. Because of that, I was able to publish it as an NPM package instead of just code snippets.

## What are the differences with other loading animation packages?
&zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> is opinionated, it generates a pro-quality loading animations which are completely customizable and auto-responsive.  

It includes many features:

- Works with any web framework
- Color Customization
- Size Customization
- Auto responsive (If `desktopSize` and `mobileSize` is not specified)
- Awesome performance & scalability
- Extra-ordinary 3D animations
- Use of diverse & most efficient packages (while creating)
- ..and many other features!  

All of these features make &zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> the most advanced loading animation package.

## Personalize options  
Customization parameters are passed as props to particular loader in the package.  

```jsx highlight={1,6-10}
import { LoaderName } from "react-awesome-loaders"
...
function LoadingComponent(props) {
    return (
        ...
        <LoaderName 
            className={'myloader'}
            desktopSize={'128px'} 
            mobileSize={'64px'}
        />
        ...
    );
}
export default LoadingComponent
```  

You can look at the corresponding loader documentation on this website to see what parameters can be customized.

# Why use React Awesome Loaders

&zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> is a library that focuses on making complex loading animations easy to configure.

In most situations, building loading simple animations using `css` properties becomes easy since you only need to create for particular use case. Responsiveness for this can be handled with media queries with ease.

But what if we want to create complex animations and we want to scale it? It will take lot of effort and time to create such animations just using `css`. Moreover, customizing parameters like size, colors and speed through `css` is another problem.

&zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> solves this problem by using advanced animation libraries like `gsap`, `zdog`, `three`, `react-spring` which works based on physics and the relative motion/speed of animating objects can be handled w.r.t each other. The responsiveness is handled using `react-responsive`. Moreover, the customizing parameters like size and colors is handled through use of **CSS in JS** by using `styled-components`.

## Official Project Launch

We launched &zwnj;<AwesomeLoaders/> project on the creator's YouTube channel [**Dev Sense**](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevSense19). You can watch below video to see the official launch of the project.

<div className={styles.playerWrapper}>
  <ReactPlayer
    className={styles.player}
    light
    playing
    url="https://youtu.be/_1mDp8ZKfgY"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
  />
</div>

## Rise of concept

I have created a video tutorial few months back illustrating the complex logo building animation for splash screen just using `css`. You can look at below video to see how it looked like. In the duration of finding `css` solution, I went through many design concepts on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) as well as [codepen](https://codepen.io/) and came up with scalable implementations of the findings.

<div className={styles.playerWrapper}>
  <ReactPlayer
    className={styles.player}
    light
    playing

    width="100%"
    height="100%"
  />
</div>

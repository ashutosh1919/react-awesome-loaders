There are many other dependencies which the project has used internally. You can check them in `package.json` in the Github repository.

Note that I have mentioned the original creator of concept first proof of concept link at the bottom of each loader document. I have writtern `Inspired` because I have made major code modifications. Code modifications includes converting `sass`, `css` and `stylus` files to components with `styled-components`.Â This also includes making animation codes scalable as well as responsive. Customising parameters is also something which I introduced.
